The EmployeeRestApi repository is a demo project. It creates a RESTful webservice on http://localhost:8080.

Users are able to create, read, update and delete employees from the API.

To do so, you need to use a HTTP-Client like [postman](https://www.postman.com/) on this URL:
http://localhost:8080/employees. The data is stored in your RAM.

An employee has the following properties:
- id (auto-incremented)
- firstName
- surName
- emailAddress
